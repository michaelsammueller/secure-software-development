# Summary of Details about ISS

## Priorities

* Decrease the risk of collision with micrometeroid and orbital debris. [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf)
* Decrease spotaneous crew illness

## Requirements

* Two failure-tolerance to catastrophic hazards requirement [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf)
* One failure-tolerance to critical hazards requirement [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf)
* Design for minimum risk [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf)
* Mitigation methods can include: switching systems, crew repairs or logisitic deliveries; except during time-critical exceptions such as: loss of cabin pressure, collisions, toxic spills and fires. Catastrophic collisions have likelihood of under 10% over 10 years. [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf)
* Diligence in monitoring the ISS. [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf)
* In flight health monitoring. Medical events are expected every four-six years for a team of six. [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf)
* Criticality 1 hazardous commands are required to be two stage, and can only be unsafed by Mission Control Center-Houston, before being resafed again [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf).
* Criticality 2 hazardous commands are required to have popups, and are unsafable by individual ground controller. Command accuracy is around 99.95%,, and can only be unsafed by Mission Control Center-Houston, before being resafed again. [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf)

## Regulations

* NASA Authorization Act 2005 - Establishment of independent
task force to discover and assess vulnerabilities. [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf)

* NASA Policy Directive 2810.1C - Establishes overall security policy. [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf)

* NASA Policy Regulation 2810.1A - Requirements of NSA approved encryption. [(NASA, 2007)](final_report_of_the_international_space_station_independent_safety_task_force.pdf)

* International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) - US regulation on defense and military related technologies.

* Contamination,
  * Mitigations include control of types and quantities
* Collisions,
* Fatigue
  * Attributed as the cause of Progress collsions with Mir
* Sabotage,
* System Failure,
  * Mitigations include repairability
* Pressure Leaks
  * Mitigations include modular design of ISS.
* Radiation
  * Mitigations include monitoring, operations adaptions

## Software Security

> "The software and workstations that perform communications and commanding functions
also have several security measures. Security for the MCC workstations is governed by and
consistent with the National Information Assurance Policy for U.S. Space Systems. All work-
stations for command and telemetry are continuously monitored by standard anti-virus and spy-
ware protection software and are scanned quarterly for vulnerabilities using the latest industry
standard security software. Password protection is in place on all workstations and only certain
users/accounts can access ISS commanding servers, which require an additional password.
Access to ISS commanding is further limited by partitioning available commands by user
groups, and users only have access to the commands necessary to perform that disciplineâ€™s
function. To provide a quality check of commands, two people are required to perform a
command. Finally, all commands to the vehicle are encrypted and must pass through a
series of validity and authentications checks"
