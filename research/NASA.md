## NASA report - ideas for system:
*page 15: "Per the agency’s checks-and-balances governance model, the Chief Safety Officer has the authority to approve on behalf of Headquarters OSMA any and all program level technical waivers, NCRs, new safety requirements, and exceptions to existing technical requirements. The Chief Safety Officer also has OSMA’s authority to direct suspension of any activity that presents an immediate hazard (imminent danger) or future hazard to personnel, property, or mission operations due to unsafe acts or conditions that might be identified by either inspection or analysis."

--> a system to authorise extraordinary procedures

*page 16: The S&MA functions (both integral and independent) are operative though all phases of the ISS Program in establishing design and operational safety requirements, performing safety assessments, reviewing designs to assure safety requirements are implemented, and performing operational safety assessments"

--> a system for recording safety assessments

*page 16: "The ISS safety panels are responsible for the review and approval of the hazard reports and safety data packages required for flight approval. The Safety Review Panel (SRP) assesses the safety and design of all NASA and IP segments, related flight support equipment, ISS visiting vehicles, ISS assembly operations including extravehicular activity (EVA), and integrated hazards. The Safety and Mission Assurance Review Team (SMART) assesses the safety of ISS government-furnished equipment and ISS cargo. The Payload Safety Review Panel (PRSP) assesses the safety of all ISS and Shuttle payloads. The safety panels obtain technical support from the NASA engineering organizations, operations organizations, and NASA S&MA organizations. Rigorous requirements and processes are in place to support these reviews." 

--> a system for viewing and approving hazard reports using a roles-based access and verification system
