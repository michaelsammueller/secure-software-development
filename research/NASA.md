## NASA space station general research:

*international space station live updates: https://www.space.com/news/live/international-space-station-live-updates

## Context
- The International Space Station (ISS) Safety Task Force was established to review a broad range of Station vulnerabilities and consequences.
- The ISSTF is an independent task force to discover and assess any vulnerabilities of the ISS. It analysed cross-cutting management functions in the report.
- The ISSTF identified following vulnerabilities:
    - Loss of crew member and/or loss of Station 
    - Premature abandonment of the Station 
    - Crew health 
- The ISS program is comprised of International Partners (IPs)/ interwoven partnerships - operation of the ISS is distributed across IP facilities around the world.
- In addition to the IPs, NASA also distributes management functions to multiple NASA field centers.
- The Station is managed and integrated by the ISS Program Office.
- Complex electrical power, cooling and heating, and computer/ data networks are connected and distributed throughout the ISS.
- The ISS safety and mission assurance (S&MA) organization, including matrixed NASA institutional support, is responsible for managing the ISS safety program:

- The S&MA are responsible for establishing design and operational safety requirements, performing safety assessments, reviewing designs to assure safety requirements are implemented and performing operational safety assessments

## NASA report - ideas for system:

*a system to authorise extraordinary procedures (page 15)

*a system for recording safety assessments (page 16)

*a system for viewing and approving hazard reports using a roles-based access and verification system (page 16)

*anomoly detection and resolution (page 16 and 40)

*system to support 'program risks' matrix? (page 17-18)

*a system to support the Certification of Flight readiness process (page 18)

*system to support hazard reporting (page 28)

*consumables monitoring (page 41)

*a system for monitoring facility access (page 44)

*health monitoring of crew (pre-, during or post-flight) (page 46)

*in-flight sleep/ circadian monitoring of crew to assess for 'readiness' (page 49)

*illness symptoms reporting (page 50)
