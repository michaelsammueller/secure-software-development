# Astronaut Health Monitoring Application
**A group project for the post-graduate Computer Science programs at the University of Essex Online.**

Module: _Secure Software Development_\
Team Name: _SecureSpace_\
Members: _Bradley Graham, Michael Sammueller, Tomas Mestanza & Rachel Doherty_

### Description
This application is intended for use by astronauts to record health indicators related to their physical fitness and mental health during a space mission. It also models the measurement of ambient temperature and radiation exposure via onboard sensors.

The project domain is the International Space Station (ISS), which is a collaborative international space travel and research program between 15 governments, overseen and facilitated by NASA. The  application is intended to support the health and safety of astronauts aboard the ISS during a mission in order to prevent crew health issues jeopardising the success of a mission.

The project brief is to implement secure software development principles into the application design. 

#### Application features & Technologies:
- **Languages:** Python / SQL
- **Database:** SQLite3
- **Interface:** Command Line
- **Network requirements**: Ethernet - access is via a local terminal (no web access)

#### How to run the project:

## GDPR
The application is developed according to UK GDPR.

The lawful basis for data processing is subject to:
1) the consent of the data subjects;
2) the vital interests of crew health as a key ISS vulnerability (IISTF, 2007);
3) the continuation of ISS operations, as outlined in the legal framework of the ISS (IISTF, 2007)

It is assumed that astronaut consent to data processing is sought before any mission commences by that respective national space travel authority (e.g. the UK Space Agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency etc.).
