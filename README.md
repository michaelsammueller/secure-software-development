## Database

This solution makes use of a relational database to store data relevant to the system. 

Normalisation has been applied to the database design. Applying the normalisation theory aims to reduce data redundancy and avoid potential problems when performing operations on the database (Eessaar, 2016). 

As a consequence of applying normalisation, consistency is improved, and maintenance is reduced in complexity.
