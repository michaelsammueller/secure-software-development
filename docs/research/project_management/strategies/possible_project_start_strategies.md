## Methodology Shaping

> "With this little technique, you will build a small library of experiences in your
organization that show the strengths, weaknesses and themes of your organization.
When you go into the methodology shaping workshop, you will examine them and
discuss how to take advantage of the strengths and how to compensate for, or avoid,
the weaknesses."
