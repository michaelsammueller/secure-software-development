# Project Requirements

Requirements for the assignment are:

- Develop an application that provides a secure repository for an organization (NASA - International Space Station) with domain-specific requirements.

- Ensure that the application supports access via a web browser and/or a command-line application that allows an authenticated user to perform CRUD capabilities.

- Ensure that all privacy and security regulations are met, including those specified by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

- Deploy mechanisms to minimize the attack surface of the solution, including authentication, authorization, data encryption, and event monitoring.

- Create a distributed/microservice version of the application to address scalability concerns.

- At least two events occurring within and/or around the application should run while the application is live, using a concurrent threading approach, which should be specific and relevant to the chosen domain.

- Produce a comprehensive design proposal report describing how the requirements will be met and the design and implementation of the solution.

- Create a working prototype of the microservice design via a command-line (CL) application.

- Provide a bulleted list of system requirements and assumptions, design decisions, and approaches based on background information and additional academic research, including references.

- Provide a bulleted list of security risks/vulnerabilities identified, including reference to frameworks used (e.g., STRIDE, OWASP) with potential mitigations and references.

- Produce a minimum of two different graphical UML design, which illustrate different views of the system, such as a sequence diagram, class diagram, and/or an activity diagram.

- List any tools and libraries used in the solution.

**IMPORTANT:** ***Get the design outline reviewed and approved by the tutor before submitting the final version in Unit 6.***
